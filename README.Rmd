Often it is useful to set bespoke options for a single workflow, or within a single package, without altering global options that influence other users or packages. This is possible `base::options()` and related functions, however doing so requires some bespoke knowledge. `{potions}` makes options management as easy as possible, by decreasing programmers' cognitive burden while storing and retrieving information. It does this by following three guiding principles:

- **minimalist**: `{potions}` has only three core functions: `brew()`, `pour()` and `drain()`
- **laconic**: functions use as few characters as possible
- **familiar**: uses a UI for data retrieval based on the `{here}` package

In combination, these features should make it easy for users and developers to manage options using {potions}.

## Getting started

Install from GitHub:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("atlasoflivingaustralia/potions")
```

To store data in options, use `brew()`
```{r}
library(potions)
brew(list(x = 1, y = list(a = 2, b = 4)))
```
  
Then you can use `pour()` to get the information you need:
```{r}
pour() |> str() # get all data

pour("x") # get a subset of data

pour("y", "a") # for nested data
```

When you are done, simply use `drain()` to clean up:
```{r}
drain()

pour() # nothing to return
```

To use in a package development situation, set `onLoad.R` to
```{r, eval=FALSE}
.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {
  if(pkgname == "my_package_name_here") {
    potions::brew(.pkg = "my_package_name_here")
  }
}
```
You can then use the above functions as you would in the console.
